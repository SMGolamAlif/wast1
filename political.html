  <p>Dhaka, Aug 14 (BDNEWS) – The life-sketch of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 
  who was billed as the greatest Bangalee of all time in an opinion poll 
  by BBC, tells the history of Bangladesh</p>
  
  <p>Sheikh Mujib was in all the phases of the history, 
  from the British colonial rule to the independence 
  of Bangladesh.</p>
   
  <p>Sheikh Mujib, the founding father of Bangladesh, 
  spent most of his life fighting against injustice to
  the Bangalees, first by the British, and then by the
  Pakistani military and civil rulers.</p>
   
  <p>After the mass uprising of 1969, he was given the title 
  "Bangabandhu," which means "Friend of Bengal." He is largely
  known as Bangabandhu among the millions of Bangalees.</p>
   
  <p>He was a young political activist during the British rule.
  He was active in every political event of the then East 
  Bengal/East Pakistan: the language movement of 1952, Jukta 
  Front election of 1954, student movement of 1962, movement 
  for 6-point demand of 1966, mass uprising of 1969, and finally
  the liberation war of 1971 against Pakistanis. He was in prison
  for more than a decade during the 24-year Pakistani rule.</p>
   
  <p>But the irony is that what the Pakistanis could not do, 
  some corrupt military officers did it – they killed Bangabandhu 
  along with most of his extended family on August 15, 1975, just 
  after 3 and half years of the independence. Two of his daughters, 
  Shiekh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, survived, as they were abroad at 
  the time</p>
  
  <p>The same military officers killed four national leaders and
  cornerstones of the liberation war – Syed Nazrul Islam, Taz
  Uddin Ahmed, Captain Mansoor Ali and Kamruzzaman – in November
  4, 1975.</p>
   
  <p>Bangabandhu, who gave us a nation, a new country and a new identity,
  was born in a respectable Muslim family on 17 March 1920, in
  Tungipara under the then Gopalganj subdivision 
  (at present district) of Faridpur district.</p>
   
  <p>He was the third child among the four daughters and 
  two sons of Sheikh Luthfur Rahman and Sheikh Sahara Khatun.
  His parents called him Khoka out of affection. Bangabandhu 
  spent his childhood in Tungipara</p>
   
  <p>At the age of seven, Bangabandhu began his schooling
  at Gimadanga Primary School. At nine, he was admitted 
  to class three at Gopalganj Public School. Subsequently, 
  he was transferred to a local Missionary School.</p>
  
  <p>At eighteen Mujib married Begum Fazilatunnesa. 
  They later became the parents of two daughters –
  Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana – and three sons – 
  Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Rassel.</p>
  
  <p>Bangabandhu's political career began when 
  he was a student of Gopalganj Missionary School.
  He led a group of students to demand that 
  cracked roof of the school be repaired when 
  'Sher-e-Bangla' A.K. Fazlul Haque, Chief Minister 
  of undivided Bengal, came to visit the school 
  along with Hussein Shaheed Suhrawardy.</p>
  
  <p>Sheikh Mujib passed the Entrance examination 
  (Currently the Secondary School Certificate) 
  and then took admission as an intermediate
  student to the Humanities faculty of Calcutta 
  Islamia College, where he had lodgings at Baker 
  Hostel. The same year Bangabandhu got actively 
  involved in the movement for the creation of Pakistan.</p>
  
  <p>Sheikh Mujib's busy and active political 
  career took off in the literal sense with his 
  election as a Councillor of the Muslim League</p>
  
  
  <p>Sheikh Mujib was elected General Secretary 
  of Islamia College Students Union.</p>
  
  <p>Bangbandhu obtained Bachelor of Arts degree from 
  Islamia College under Calcutta Universiy. When communal 
  riots broke out in the wake of the partition of India
  and the birth of Pakistan, Bangabandhu played a pioneering
  role in protecting Muslims and trying to contain the 
  violence.</p>
  
  <p>Bangabandhu got admission to the Law Department 
  of Dhaka University after the partition of Indian 
  sub-continent and founded Muslim Students League.</p>
  
  <p>When the East Pakistan Awami Muslim League 
  was formed on 23 June 1948, Sheikh Mujib was 
  elected its Joint Secretary.</p>
  
  
  <p>On 26 January, 1952, Khwaja Najimuddin 
  declared that Urdu would be the state language of 
  Pakistan. Though still in jail, Bangabandhu managed 
  to play a leading role in organizing a protest
  against this announcement.</p>
  
  <p>On 9 July, 1953, Mujib was elected 
  General Secretary of East Pakistan Awami 
  League at its council session.</p>
  
  <p>The first general election of Pakistan 
  was held on 10 March1954. The Jukta Front 
  (United Front) won 223 seats out of a total
  of 237, including 143 captured by the Awami League.
</p>
  
  <p>Bangabandhu swept the 
  Gopalganj constituencey, defeating the 
  powerful Muslim League leader Wahiduzzaman 
  by a magin of 1300 votes.
</p>
  
  <p>Bangabandhu was elected a member of the
  legislative Assembly in June1955.</p>
  
  <p>Pakistan's President, Major General Iskandar
  Mirja, and the chief of Pakistan's Army, General
  Ayub Khan, imposed martial law on 7 October 1958
  and banned politics.</p>
  
  <p>Bangabandhu was arrested on 11 October 1958. 
  Thereafter he was continuously harassed through
  one false case after another.</p>
  
  <p>On 5 February, 1966, a national conference of 
  the opposition parties was held in Lahore. 
  Bangabandhu placed his historic 6-point demand
  before the select committee of the conference. 
  The 6-point demand was a palpable charter of freedom 
  of the Bengali nation.</p>
  
  <p>On the first day of March, Bangabandhu was 
  elected President of the Awami League. Following 
  his election, he launched a campaign to obtain 
  enthusiastic support for the 6-point demand.</p>
  
  <p>The Pakistan government instituted the 
  notorious Agartala Conspiracy Case against 
  Bangabandhu and 34 Bengali military and CSP 
  officers in 1968. Sheikh Mujib was named 
  accused number one in the case that charged
  the arrested persons with conspiring to bring 
  about the secession of East Pakistan from the 
  rest of Pakistan.</p>
  
  <p>The Central Students Action Council was 
  formed on 5 January 1969 to press for the 
  11-point demand of Bangabandhu. The council 
  initiated a countrywide student agitation to 
  force the government to withdraw the Agartala
  Conspiracy Case and release Bangabadhu.</p>
  
  <p>After months of protests, 
  violation of Section 144 and curfews, 
  firing by the police and the EPR and a 
  number of casualties, the movement peaked 
  into an unprecedented mass upsurge. 
  The central government bowed to the 
  mass protests and freed Bangabandhu 
  and the other co-accused. The conspiracy 
  case was withdrawn.</p>
  
  <p>The Central Students Action Council 
  arranged a reception in honour of Sheikh Mujibur
  Rahman on 23 February at the Race Course 
  (Suhrawardy Uddyan). At this meeting of one million 
  people, Mujib was publicly acclaimed as Bangabandhu 
  (Friend of Bengal).</p>
  
  <p>Bangabandhu was re-elected President of the
  Awami League on 6 January, 1970. The Awami League
  at a meeting of the working committee on 1 April 
  decided to take part in the general elections
  scheduled for later that year. The Awami League
  secured 167 out of 169 National Assembly seats
  in the Provincial Assembly.</p>
  
  <p>On 1 March, 1971, Yahya Khan abruptly postponed 
  the National Assembly session, prompting a storm of
  protest throughout Bangladesh.</p>
  
  <p>On 7 March, 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,
  addressed a mammoth public rally at the Race Course ground,
  where he called upon the people to prepare for the struggle
  for independence.</p>
  
  <p>On the night of 25 March, the Pakistan Army cracked down
  on the innocent unarmed Bangalees. They attacked Dhaka University, 
  the Peelkhana Headquarters of the then East Pakistan Rifles and the 
  Rajarbagh Police Headquarters.
</p>
  
  <p>Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman read out a wireless message, 
  moments after the crackdown began, declaring the independence of
  Bangladesh as 25 March gave away to 26 March. His declaration was
  transmitted over wireless to the country.</p>
  
  <p>The Pakistan army arrested Bangabandhu from his Dhanmandi residence 
  at 1:10 a.m. and whisked him away to Dhaka cantonment. On 26 March he was 
  flown to Pakistan as a prisoner. He was freed after the independence of 
  Bangladesh.</p>
